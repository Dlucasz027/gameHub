    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>My name is Matheus de Lucas, better known on YouTube by my nickname D'Lucas, which comes from my last name.
        I'm 24 years old, a student of Systems Analysis and Development, and a YouTuber as a hobby.
        I've been creating content since 2019, although, due to various issues, this is my second gaming channel.
        
        While other YouTubers have huge numbers, I consider myself a winner. For a long time, I believed what I do today was impossible, but when I decided to try, I made two channels work, with a lot of discipline and perseverance.
        Just like one day I thought it was impossible to have an audience as a YouTuber, recently I also thought it was impossible to create a website, even one as simple as this... But look at the result, here I am, once again overcoming my limitations.
        
        The purpose of creating this page is to practice my front-end knowledge, even if using only markup and styling languages.
        I am proud of creating my first project as a developer. I hope you like it!
</p>
